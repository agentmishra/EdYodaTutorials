OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
In JS, Object is a collection of key-value pairs
E.g
person = {
    fName: "John",
    lName: "Doe",
    address: "123,ABC Street",
    getAddress: function () {
        return "123, ABC Street";
    }
}

person.address;
person.fName;
person.getAddress();


Constructor Function : The fn starts with a Capital Letter in its name and take initial values. E.g function Car(wheels, color, engineType,cc) {

}

Constructor : It is a function which initializes the values of a function/class.
new : Keyword is used to create instances of a type


this? => this keyword represents context (Where the peice of code/variable/function lives)

In OOP we create 2 type of functions to read/update the values in side an object, i.e getter and setter

Types of programming in JS : procedural programming and Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming


Real Life Example : 
I want to change the color of car object.
I want to change the color of this object.
